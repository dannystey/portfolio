                    <p>
                        This website contains links to external third-party websites. I have no influence on the contents of those websites, therefore I cannot assume any liability for those external contents. The providers or operators of the linked websites are always responsible for their own content. The linked websites were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal contents were not recognized at the time of linking. A permanent control of the contents of the linked websites is not reasonable without concrete evidence of an infringement. Upon notification of violations, I will remove such links immediately.
